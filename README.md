## Hello!

I'm Asher. I'm just some guy that enjoys writing software.

## 🛠️ Skills and Tools

- **Languages**: Python, Swift, C#, Dart

- Lines I always run to track my progress on zsh (Deprecated. Use `cl <file_extension>` command instead):
```bash
find . -name '*.cs' -print0 | xargs -0 wc -l
find . -name '*.swift' -print0 | xargs -0 wc -l
find . -name '*.dart' -print0 | xargs -0 wc -l
```
